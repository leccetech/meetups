# meetups

Hello Everyone,

We recently started this tech community in [Lecce, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecce) to promote technology and organise tech community meetups (since we are software engineers and loves tech and like to network with fellow techie's around and loves talking about technology and share our learnings and tech experiences - I am sure YOU love tech too and would like to be-a-part or support us in this).

In the meetup's we talk about technologies/tools, programming languages and frameworks (especially on web &amp; mobile like node.js, angular, react, javascript, typescript, php, python etc). Also, we'd like to connect to tech companies and sponsors too for organising our meetups better and more often. So, If you have some connections in your network or maybe thoughts, you could reach us out and we'd love to meet you up.

I'd recommend you guys to join our facebook [group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tech.in.lecce) & [page](https://www.facebook.com/LecceTechCommunity) and be a part of this community. Also, you can like our facebook page for public news and upcoming meetups/events.

You may find our facebook page and group links here:

* FB Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/tech.in.lecce
* FB Page: https://www.facebook.com/LecceTechCommunity

In the end, We'd like to connect to IT students and more techie people so would be really great if you could also share in your network.

Cheers,
